It took a while, but it's finally here... 🕑
## Introducing a JDA version of RiiConnect24 Bot
...or rather, what's on master. What is currently running, I can't say.

## Why did you make it in JDA?
While `discordrb` (Ruby) is awesome, it usually takes quite a bit for newly added API features to come out. That's fine for most bots, but most people in the community wanted the latest as soon as possible.

Also, the fact that more users know Java in RiiConnect24's community along with the fact that Java is a more tried and tested language that works helped the decision.

## How do I set it up?
I'm glad you asked. We no longer use YAML except for the config (which was just a Ruby class before), as Java really doesn't like YAML.

Check out the following steps:
1. You'll need to have Redis and Gradle installed. (PowerTip ⚡: You can always stick with what version of gradle is being used currently by substituting all usages of `gradle` with `./gradlew` or `./gradlew.bat`.)
2. We'll create the Redis structures as we go, so no need to set anything up. Unless you're converting from the Ruby 💎 version, in which you'll want the *unwritten yaml -> Redis scripts*. They're coming, we promise! 🔜
3. `git clone` the repo somewhere and `cd` into it. 💻
4. It's time to start the 🔨... `gradle build`! And... tada! That's it. 🎉 You can find JAR(s) created in `build/libs`. Easy! 👌👍
5. For running, make sure you have redis installed on whatever machine. Also, if `config.yml` can't be found, it'll copy a default copy to the current directory for you. 🏃
